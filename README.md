print: Print the list.
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer .
append e: Insert integer  at the end of the list.
sort: Sort the list.
pop: Pop the last element from the list.
reverse: Reverse the list.

Initialize your list and read in the value of  followed by  lines of commands where each command will be of the  types listed above. 
Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

As Strings are immutable, try to mutuate them using various approaches 
either by converting to list and then make changes or by slice the string and join it back.

**Problem 5**

Consider String S and length n and integer k, where k is the factor of n 
we can split the string s into n/k substrings where each substring consists of a block of k charecters in s.
Here we are considering a String and splitting it to required blocks and then removing the duplicates and printing as individual blocks
