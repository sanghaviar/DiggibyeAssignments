**Problem 1**

Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:
insert i e: Insert integer  at position .
print: Print the list.
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer .
append e: Insert integer  at the end of the list.
sort: Sort the list.
pop: Pop the last element from the list.
reverse: Reverse the list.

Initialize your list and read in the value of  followed by  lines of commands where each command will be of the  types listed above. 
Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

**Problem 4**

As Strings are immutable, try to mutuate them using various approaches 
either by converting to list and then make changes or by slice the string and join it back.

**Problem 5**

Consider String S and length n and integer k, where k is the factor of n 
we can split the string s into n/k substrings where each substring consists of a block of k charecters in s.
Here we are considering a String and splitting it to required blocks and then removing the duplicates and printing as individual blocks 

**Problem 6**

Given an integer n, print the values for each integer i, from 1 to n 
1. Decimal
2. Octal
3. Hexadecimal
4. Binary
These values must be printed in the specified order and should be space-padded to match the width of the binary
value of the number and values must be seperated by a single space

**Problem 10**
write a code to find the absolute difference in seconds between two given timestamps provided in a specific format, including the time zone offset. To calculate 
the difference, we convert both timestamps to UTC (Universal Coordinated Time) to account for different time zones and then find the time difference in seconds, 
taking the absolute value for a non-negative result.

**Problem 14**

There is an array of  integers. There are also  disjoint sets, A and B , each containing m integers. You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the 
integers in set B.Initial Happiness is 0.For each integer i in the array, if i belong to A, ass 1 to your hapiness. If i belong to B, you add -1 to your
happiness
Otherwise your happiness does not change.
